# Tic-Tac-Toe
SEI Project 1:

Tic Tac Toe is a fun game played between two people taking in turns to try and place their symbol three spots in a row.

## [Click Here](https://www.example.com) to see my live project!

## How to play
- Click the link above.
- Player "X" goes first then player "O".
- Take in turns clicking on the grid.
- First player to have their three of their symbol line up WINS!.
- Restart at anytime or after somebody has won by clicking the restart button. ***Coming Soon***


## Initial Plan
1. Create a 9x9 grid with a header.
2. Have the eventListener add text to grid when clicked individually.
3. Have the eventListener cycle through "X" & "O" (taking turns) when clicking.
4. Winner is awarded from an array of predefined positions for either "X" or "O".
5. Winner window is shown once a winner has been awarded.
6. Restart button reloads window.
7. Change restart button reset everything without reloading website.

## Struggles:
I really struggled with making the event handler take it in turns with applying either a "X" or "O", so for a work around until I figured out how to do that, I just made the user cycle through the options with a click. I eventually found help on stack overflow with a similar problem that helped me.

## Bugs to Fix
- Restart button currently not doing anything.
- When game is a draw nothing happens.
- Make prettier

## Future Features
- Restart button
- Next game button after winner is awarded
- Keep scores between players
- Player chosen symbol
