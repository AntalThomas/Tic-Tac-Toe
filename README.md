# Tic-Tac-Toe
SEI Project 1


## Plan
1. Create a 9x9 grid with a header.
2. Have the eventListener add text to grid when clicked individually.
3. Have the eventListener cycle through "X" & "O" (taking turns) when clicking.
4. Winner is awarded from an array of predefined positions for either "X" or "O".
5. Winner window is shown once a winner has been awarded.
6. Restart button reloads window.
7. Change restart button reset everything without reloading website.

## Struggles:
I really struggled with making the event handler take it in turns with applying either a "X" or "O", so for a work around until I figured out how to do that, I just made the user cycle through the options with a click. I eventually found something online that helped me.
